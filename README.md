# Testeorama

**Testeorama** is a modern web application for saving, searching, and sharing culinary recipes.  
It was created for those who love to cook and share their flavors with others.  
This project was developed as part of the final assignment at the IT school GoIT.

## 📌 About the Project

All student teams were given the same layout and technical specification to collaboratively implement a real-world project.

Over the course of two weeks, students were challenged to develop a **responsive**, **accessible**, and **interactive web application**, demonstrating the skills they had acquired in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Node.js**.

The goal was not only to meet the technical requirements, but to create a user-friendly product that reflects real development practices and teamwork.

## ⚙️ Features 

Our application is built with attention to both user experience and robust architecture. Here's what powers it:

- 📱 **Responsive Design**  
  Seamlessly adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens for a smooth experience across all devices.

- 🎨 **Styling with CSS Modules**  
  Scoped styles ensure modularity and prevent conflicts, keeping the UI clean and maintainable.

- 🧭 **Routing with React Router DOM**  
  Includes public and private routes to manage access and navigation intuitively.

- 🧠 **State Management via Redux Toolkit**  
  Efficient state handling using `slice`, `selectors`, and `asyncThunk` for asynchronous logic.

- 🚨 **Error Handling**  
  - Form validation messages for user input feedback  
  - Push notifications for request errors to keep users informed

- ⏳ **Data Fetching Indicators**  
  Loaders are displayed during all API requests to enhance clarity and user trust.

- ✅ **Form Validation**  
  Implemented with Formik and Yup for structured, reliable input validation.
